WebShare
========

Python utility to share the files in a directory via web browser.
This process makes use of the [bottle](http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html) microframework and [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) to present a web view of a directories contents.
Directory traversal is now supported but I have only been able to test on Ubuntu thus far.

To execute, run the following
`python fshare.py [path to directory]`

Hope you find this useful.
